# Updated algorithm/mod.rs File

The following is a proposed update to the `src/algorithm/mod.rs` file that would be part of the restructuring effort. This file shows how we would organize the module exports to maintain backward compatibility while introducing the new structure.

```rust
//! Algorithms for the IDS-RS library
//!
//! This module contains the algorithms for sampling, matching, balance checking,
//! population data generation, and health data processing.

// Core algorithms that are not specific to population or health data
pub mod matching;
pub mod balance;
pub mod statistics;
pub mod sampler;

// Population submodule
pub mod population;

// Health data submodule
pub mod health;

// Re-export for backward compatibility
// These will be deprecated in a future version
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use population::core as population_deprecated;
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use population::integration as population_integration;
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use population::classification as population_scd;
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use health::lpr as lpr;
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use health::diagnosis::scd as scd;
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use health::diagnosis::secondary as secondary_diagnosis;
```

//! Population data processing algorithms
//!
//! This module implements algorithms for population data generation, classification,
//! and integration with additional registers.

pub mod core;
pub mod integration;
pub mod classification;

// Re-export common types
pub use core::{PopulationConfig, PopulationSummary};
pub use integration::integrate_population_data;
pub use classification::{PopulationScdConfig, PopulationScdResult};

/// Generate a population dataset with optional SCD classification and register integration
///
/// This is a convenience function that combines the core population generation,
/// optional SCD classification, and optional register integration.
pub fn generate_population_with_classification(
    // Parameters would be a combination of parameters from the various components
) -> Result<RecordBatch> {
    // Implementation would call the component functions in sequence
}

// Re-export common types
pub use lpr::LprConfig;
pub use diagnosis::scd::{ScdConfig, ScdResult, ScdDiseaseCodes};

    // Parameters would combine those from LPR and SCD processing
) -> Result<RecordBatch> {
