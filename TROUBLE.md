# IDS-RS Optimization Summary

## Previously Implemented Optimizations (in completed PRs)

1. **Enhanced Parquet File Reading**
   - Added a multi-threaded work-stealing pool using `crossbeam-deque`
   - Implemented configurable thread count with `num_cpus`
   - Applied `rayon` parallel iterators for date range filtering

2. **Improved Balance Cache**
   - Created a 32-shard cache architecture to reduce lock contention
   - Used `parking_lot::RwLock` for more efficient synchronization
   - Implemented batch operations for fewer lock acquisitions

3. **Optimized Value Processor**
   - Added adaptive chunk sizing based on workload
   - Implemented date-based data grouping for improved cache locality
   - Refactored to support parallel processing with inlined helper functions

4. **Parallelized Matched Pair Processing**
   - Restructured `add_matched_pair_details` to use `rayon::par_iter`
   - Added batch prefetching based on date grouping
   - Used thread-safe collections with minimal lock contention

## New Core Optimizations

5. **Optimized Sampler Construction**
   - Used parallel processing to collect and analyze record data
   - Implemented thread-safe approach for building birth date indices
   - Used local aggregation with minimal lock contention
   - Utilized `par_sort_unstable` for faster parallel sorting

6. **Improved Control Sampling Performance**
   - Optimized control selection with pre-collection of candidate controls
   - Reduced nested loops with flattened data structures
   - Improved locality for parent matching checks

7. **Enhanced Metric Calculations**
   - Added adaptive parallelism based on dataset size
   - Used parallel reduction for large datasets
   - Avoided parallel overhead for small datasets

8. **CSV Export Optimization**
   - Parallelized data preparation before file I/O
   - Used batched processing with minimal lock contention
   - Separated computation from I/O for better throughput

## Next Steps
- Explore additional thread-pool tuning for optimal performance
- Consider memory optimizations for extremely large datasets
- Add benchmarking capabilities to measure optimization impact
- Review performance in other computation-heavy parts of the codebase
