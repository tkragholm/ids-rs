# Refactoring Progress

## Completed Changes

### 1. ✅ Consolidated Backend Implementations
- Merged duplicate `ArrowBackend` implementations into a single optimized version in `/crates/types/src/storage/arrow/backend.rs`
- Removed redundant implementation from `/crates/types/src/store/arrow_backend.rs`
- Updated all imports and references to use the consolidated implementation

### 2. ✅ Created Shared Cache Key Type
- Moved `CacheKey` to the central storage module to avoid duplication
- Updated all references to use the shared type
- Set up proper exports to maintain compatibility

### 3. ✅ Simplified DataStore Abstraction
- Replaced complex `DataStore` with a cleaner enum-based approach
- Removed unnecessary `Arc<dyn Store>` indirection
- Made delegation to specific backends more direct and explicit
- Eliminated redundant caching layer

### 4. ✅ Fixed Compiler Errors
- Resolved type mismatch issues in `ArrowBackend` implementation
- Fixed mutability issues in various trait implementations
- Addressed threading/concurrency issues with the Store trait

### 5. ✅ Streamlined Concurrency Approach
- Created a unified `ThreadSafeStore<S>` wrapper for all store implementations
- Standardized on `parking_lot::{RwLock, Mutex}` primitives for better performance
- Replaced `std::sync::Mutex` with more efficient `RwLock` for read-heavy workloads
- Implemented a high-performance `ShardedCache` with minimal lock contention
- Updated all dependent code to use the new concurrency primitives
- Created a single `CovariateCache` implementation that's optimized for concurrent access

## Current Work in Progress

### 1. ✅ Simplify Caching Strategy

We've completed streamlining our caching approach by standardizing on a single caching solution for all data access patterns.

#### Completed work:
- Standardized on the well-optimized `CovariateCache` implementation in the `storage::concurrency` module
- Replaced all legacy caching mechanisms with the new implementation
- Standardized cache key generation using the central `CacheKey` type from `types::storage`
- Updated all test code to use the standardized caching mechanism
- Ensured backward compatibility while removing redundant implementations

## Remaining Tasks

### 2. ✅ Remove Legacy Compatibility Code
- [x] Removed deprecated traits (LegacyStoreExt, LegacyFamilyAccess, LegacyTimeVaryingAccess, LegacyStore)
- [x] Removed deprecated methods with `get_` prefix from all models
- [x] Removed legacy compatibility re-exports from prelude.rs
- [x] Updated module visibility to discourage use of legacy modules

### 3. ✅ Consolidate Utility Functions
- [x] Identified common utility functions (period finding, PNR lookups, string handling)
- [x] Created dedicated utility modules with comprehensive implementations
- [x] Unified core utility functionality under a common structure

#### Completed work:
- Created comprehensive `date_utils` module with consistent interfaces
- Created standardized `string_utils` module with improved string handling
- Created unified `pnr_utils` module with enhanced functionality
- Created dedicated `file_patterns` module for file handling operations
- Maintained backward compatibility while providing improved APIs
- Added comprehensive tests for all utility functions

### 4. Optimize Data Structure Usage
- [ ] Standardize on specific collections based on actual performance needs
- [ ] Consider replacing complex custom solutions with simpler alternatives
- [ ] Profile for actual performance benefits of optimizations

### 5. Streamline Error Handling
- [ ] Standardize on the `?` operator for error propagation
- [ ] Make error types more specific for better handling
- [ ] Avoid ignoring errors without good reason

### 6. Reduce Lock Contention
- [ ] Consider lock-free data structures where possible
- [ ] Use fine-grained locking instead of locking entire stores
- [ ] Explore immutable data sharing with `Arc` without mutexes
