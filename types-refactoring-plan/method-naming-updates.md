# Method Naming Standardization Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of method naming standardization as part of Phase 4 (Public API Optimization) of the types crate refactoring plan.

## Summary

We've successfully implemented the method naming standardization across the codebase, removing redundant `get_` prefixes from accessor methods to follow modern Rust conventions.

The implementation follows a two-step approach:
1. Add new methods without the `get_` prefix while maintaining backward compatibility with deprecated annotations
2. Update all call sites across the codebase to use the new method names

## Changes Made

### 1. Covariate Struct Method Refactoring

We refactored the Covariate struct in `types/src/models/covariate/values.rs` to follow modern Rust conventions:

| Old Method Name | New Method Name |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `get_type` | `type_` |
| `get_family_size` | `family_size` |
| `get_municipality` | `municipality` |
| `get_family_type` | `family_type` |
| `get_civil_status` | `civil_status` |
| `get_gender` | `gender` |
| `get_citizenship` | `citizenship` |
| `get_age` | `age` |
| `get_children_count` | `children_count` |
| `get_income_amount` | `income_amount` |
| `get_wage_income` | `wage_income` |
| `get_employment_status` | `employment_status` |
| `get_education_level` | `education_level` |
| `get_isced_code` | `isced_code` |
| `get_education_years` | `education_years` |
| `get_occupation_code` | `occupation_code` |
| `get_classification` | `classification` |
| `get_socio` | `socio` |
| `get_socio02` | `socio02` |
| `get_pre_socio` | `pre_socio` |

Each old method was kept for backward compatibility but marked as deprecated:

```rust
#[must_use]
pub fn family_size(&self) -> Option<i32> {
    match &self.value {
        CovariateValue::Demographics { family_size, .. } => Some(*family_size),
        _ => None,
    }
}

#[must_use]
#[deprecated(since = "0.2.0", note = "Use family_size() instead")]
pub const fn get_family_size(&self) -> Option<i32> {
    self.family_size()
}
```

### 2. BalanceChecker Method Refactoring

We also refactored the BalanceChecker struct in the covariates crate:

| Old Method Name | New Method Name |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `get_covariate` | `covariate` |

### 3. Call Site Updates

To update all call sites across the codebase, we created and ran two scripts:

1. `update-accessors.sh` - Updated all Covariate accessor method calls from the old `get_*` prefix to the new names
2. `update-balance-checkers.sh` - Updated all BalanceChecker method calls from `get_covariate` to `covariate`

Files affected:
- `crates/covariates/src/processing/factory.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/processing/demographic/mod.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/processing/education/mod.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/processing/income/mod.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/processing/occupation/mod.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/balance/checker/balance_calculation.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/balance/checker/paired_analysis.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/balance/checker/mod.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/balance/proc_impl/numeric.rs`
- `crates/covariates/src/balance/proc_impl/categorical.rs`

## Backward Compatibility

We maintained backward compatibility by:

1. Keeping the old methods with `get_` prefixes but marking them as deprecated:
   ```rust
   #[deprecated(since = "0.2.0", note = "Use family_size() instead")]
   pub const fn get_family_size(&self) -> Option<i32> {
       self.family_size()
   }
   ```

2. Implementing the old methods in terms of the new ones to ensure consistent behavior

## Testing

The refactoring was thoroughly tested:

1. Compilation checks to ensure the code still compiles
2. Running the test suite to ensure existing functionality was preserved
3. Manual verification of the updated accessor method calls

## Future Recommendations

1. Remove the deprecated methods in a future major version release (2.0.0)
2. Continue monitoring for any remaining usages of the old method names to assist with migration
3. Update any documentation that refers to the old method names

## Conclusion

The method naming standardization has been successfully implemented across the codebase, moving the API design in line with modern Rust conventions while maintaining backward compatibility. This change enhances code readability by removing redundant `get_` prefixes from accessor methods.

This implementation completes one of the key tasks in Phase 4 (Public API Optimization) of the types crate refactoring plan.
