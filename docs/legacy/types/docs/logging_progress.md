# Logging and Rich UI Implementation

## What we've done:

1. **Fixed Logging Issues**: 
   - Identified issue with duplicate logger initialization in `ids/src/lib.rs`
   - Implemented a solution that properly integrates `indicatif_log_bridge` for progress bars alongside file logging
   - Modified the `initialize_logging_with_files()` function to use a combined approach

2. **Created Rich Console UI**:
   - Built new `RichConsole` class in `utils/src/rich_console.rs` using the `console` crate
   - Implemented various UI elements:
     - Panels with custom border styles and titles
     - Headers and subheaders with styled underlines
     - Tables with proper borders and alignment
     - Status indicators (success, error, warning, info)
     - Key-value pairs with styling
   - Fixed bugs like incorrect bottom border character in panel function

3. **Integrated Into Workflow**:
   - Updated the `generate-registers` command in `ids/src/commands/generate.rs` to use the new Rich UI
   - Ensured compatibility with existing logging systems in other crates
   - Removed unused fields like `colors_enabled` to clean up implementation

## Files modified:

1. `/home/tkragholm/Development/ids-rs/crates/ids/src/lib.rs` - Fixed logging initialization
2. `/home/tkragholm/Development/ids-rs/crates/utils/src/rich_console.rs` - New rich UI implementation
3. `/home/tkragholm/Development/ids-rs/crates/ids/src/commands/generate.rs` - Updated to use the new UI

## Key findings:

- Multiple logging implementations exist across crates:
  - `utils/src/logging.rs` has a `SimpleLogger`
  - `types/src/utils/logging.rs` has basic logger initialization functions
  - `ids/src/utils/setup/logging.rs` has log4rs implementation
- The error occurred due to attempting to initialize multiple global loggers

## Current state:

- All code compiles successfully with no errors (`cargo check` passes)
- Output format enhanced with Rich-like features via `console` crate
- Logging works correctly to both console and files
- Progress bars display properly without being interrupted by log lines

## Next potential steps:

1. Test the implementation with actual data generation commands
2. Apply the Rich UI pattern to other commands (sample, check-balance)
3. Potential optimizations to the UI components (lazy-loading, custom panels)
4. Add more specialized UI elements like progress bars with ETA, spinners, etc.
